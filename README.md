# Animation

Follow the example of [SwitchView](https://github.com/florent37/MyLittleCanvas/blob/master/app/src/main/java/canvastoolbox/florent37/github/com/canvastoolbox/views/SwitchView.java)

Shape animations are executed by an instance of `ShapeAnimator` attached to your view

```java
private final ShapeAnimator shapeAnimator = new ShapeAnimator(this);
```

All animated methods of shapes are wrapped into the method `.animate()`

For example, for a `CircleShape`, you can animate his position (centerX) using
```java
myCircleShape.animate().centerXTo(15);
```

Then use your `ShapeAnimator` to execute this animation

```java
shapeAnimator.play(myCircleShape.animate().centerXTo(15))
    .setDuration(500)
    .start()
```

### Difference between animated methods

#### .top(values)
//TODO
#### .topBy(values)
//TODO
#### .topPlus(values)
//TODO
#### .moveTop(values)
//TODO

# Event handling

Follow the example of [Tree View](https://github.com/florent37/MyLittleCanvas/blob/master/app/src/main/java/canvastoolbox/florent37/github/com/canvastoolbox/views/MyTreeView.java)

User events handling like *onClick* or *onTouch* are handled by an instance of `ShapeEventManager` attached to your view

```java
private final ShapeEventManager shapeAnimator = new ShapeEventManager(this);
```

## Listen click event

You can listen for a shape click using `shapeEventManager.ifClicked(shape, listener)`

```java
shapeEventManager.ifClicked(myShape, clickedShape -> {
    //your action
    myShape.setColor(Color.BLACK);
});
```

## Listen touch

To handle easier the onTouchEvent, use `shapeEventManager.ifClicked(shape, touchSetup)`

The touchSetup gives you an item `EventHelper`, which help you bind an action with an user interaction

### Custom Actions

Use `eventHelper.onDown((event) -> {/* code */})` to execute a custom action to execute on user finger down

Use `eventHelper.onMove((event) -> {/* code */})` to execute a custom action to execute on user finger move

Use `eventHelper.onUp((event) -> {/* code */})` to execute a custom action to execute on user finger up

### Bounded Actions

EventHelper can automatically bind a shape action to an user interraction

For example, you can move move the *CenterX* of a shape to the event.x using

```java
.move(myRectShape, RectShape.Pos.CENTER_X, EventPos.X)
```

Please look at implemented `RectShape.Pos` and `CircleShape.Pos`
